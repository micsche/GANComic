# Comic strip generation using GAN

In the sytle of CartoonGAN https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Chen_CartoonGAN_Generative_Adversarial_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf, this is an attempt to create a GAN using comic strips generated from real-photography

## Data
![Comic vs Film Pictures](https://github.com/micsche/GANComic/blob/main/images/film1.png)


A comic strip Corto Maltese (authored by Hugo Pratt) has been inspired by film His Majesty O'Keefe starring Burt Lancaster. This allows us to take snippets of comic and tag them to a film image, as show above. Both film and cartoon data must be processed before one can train a GAN.
